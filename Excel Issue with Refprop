I have encountered major issues in using Excel with RefProp.

Say I input the following:

=Entropy("R134a","Th","SI","368","402.51")
it returns the following:
1.19171415

However, if I would be using RefProp, using the Substance\Specified state points module,
 and inputting 368 on the Temp and 402.51 on the enthalpy, it returns the following entropy value:
 1.60000
 which I believe is the correct one..
 
 As a graduate student here in the Philippines, I have a major requirement using RefProp with links to other apps..
 We cannot use Excel/VBA because of this problem, it gives the wrong values, and I have to use other app, like
 C++/C#/MatLab
 
 Coding is tedious, if ever this problem would have been fixed, it would be a lot easier using Excel with macros made in VBA
 for calling the propper thermodynamic and transport values.
